# Customizing
## Reworking
The whole website can be reworked at will.
Effectively all pages and components can be replaced.

It is however recommended to keep the `core` as it contains solutions for backend interaction.


## Styling
The demo uses an included version of Bootstrap 5 for styling.
To customize the look of the website either apply your own sets of classes to the components or switch to another solution entirely.

## Performance
This demo often repeats certain patterns of code.
Reason for this is its nature of being a simple showcase.
When building your own product on top of this, we recommend you to refactor the pages to reusable components in order to shrink down the production size.
